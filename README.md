# HiRISE
This is the final project for my CS class "Einführung in die Computergrafik" (CG 101).

I developed my own mini-engine in opengl using some code generously provided by the "Einführung in die Computergrafik"-Team to use for this project.
The main eyecatcher here is probably the marsian surface generated from height data and a black and white satelite image.

The glsl code for it can be found [here](Code/shaders).
